# Image Fourier transform

Several  C++ implementations of 2D FT:
    - brute-force;
    - Cooleyâ€“Tukey FFT: recursive and no-recursive bit-reversal versions;
    - Stockham FFT.
    
This is not a production code, the aim was to better understand the differences between the algorithms and compare their performance by myself.
